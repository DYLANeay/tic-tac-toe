# tic-tac-toe

This was a substantial project, primarily in JavaScript. It really pushed me out of my comfort zone, allowing me to learn a lot about function behavior and solidify my foundational skills.

The logic behind it wasn't straightforward from the start, which likely cost me some time along the way. I also added the feature where the starting player is randomized. Otherwise, the game would be heavily biased towards the first player.

Skills: HTML, CSS (basic), JavaScript, Debugging (a lot)
